**Ch 3 Readme Questions**

1. The default `app.js` file generated by Express declares variables using the `var` keyword. What are the two new keywords introduced in EcmaScript 6 that the author discusses, and what is his recommendation for declaring variables in `app.js`?

The two new keywords are `const` and `let`. `const` is used to define variables with values that will not change once set (similar to Java's `final`) and `let` is used for variables with values that can be changed throughout the code.

2. What do we call the process of mapping URL requests to the functionality we want to associate with the URL? For example, when the URL `/` is requested (this represents the base URL for our application's domain), we want to execute the controller function that renders our title page. What do we call the code that connects a URL request to our controller code?

We call this process routing. The router.get('URL', function) looks for a GET request for the URL (ex: `/` - homepage) and then calls the callback function.
