contains information about the site and all the links necessary for navigation. 
There are external links to the MS program I'm enrolled in, the courses I am a TA for and 
my resume. There are internal links to some code samples and to about me page. 
There's a header bar with Home, About me and Contact fields 
and a footer. The picture sometimes is not shown on heroku.
